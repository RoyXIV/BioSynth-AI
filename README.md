# ðŸ§  BioSynth-AI: Academic PDF Analysis Assistant

BioSynth-AI is a Python-based web application built with Streamlit that empowers researchers, students, and professionals to analyze academic PDF files efficiently. The tool offers two primary modes:  
- **Single Document Analysis**: Extracts and summarizes structured content from one academic paper.  
- **Multi-Document Conceptual Analysis & Chat**: Enables upload of multiple papers to build conceptual maps and interactively explore relationships using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸ“„ Single Document Mode
- Upload and parse academic PDFs using PyMuPDF.
- Automatically extract key sections (Abstract, Methods, Results, Discussion, Limitations).
- Summarize each section using OpenAI (or local fallback with NLTK).
- Export a professionally formatted PDF report.

### ðŸ“š Multi-Document Mode
- Upload two or more PDFs for comparative analysis.
- Generate a **concept map** of relationships between papers based on content similarity.
- Use a chatbot to ask questions about uploaded papers via **FAISS** + **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
- Identify shared sections, publication years, and conceptual overlaps.
